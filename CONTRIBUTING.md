## � Contributing Document Privileges (Detailed Guide)

This is one of our most valuable contributions! Document privileges answer the question:

> "I'm Ghanaian but I have a UK visa — where else can I now travel visa-free?"

### What Are Document Privileges?

When you hold a valid visa or residence permit from certain countries (UK, US, Schengen), many other countries will let you enter visa-free or with simplified procedures.

**Current Document Privileges We Track:**
- 🇬🇧 **UK visa/BRP** → Unlocks 31+ countries
- 🇺🇸 **US visa** → Unlocks 13+ countries  
- 🇪🇺 **Schengen visa** → Unlocks 15+ countries (coming soon)
- 🇨🇦 **Canada visa** → Unlocks 8+ countries (coming soon)

### Common Anchor Visa Countries (What We Need Data For)

We're looking for privileges granted by these "anchor" visas:

1. **UK visa/BRP** - Many Balkans, Caribbean, Americas
2. **US visa** - Mexico, Latin America, some Asia
3. **Schengen visa** - Balkans, some Middle East
4. **Canada visa** - Some Latin America
5. **Australia visa** - Limited
6. **Japan visa** - Some Southeast Asia

### How to Find New Privileges

1. **Search immigration forums** - Find reports then verify with government source
2. **Check destination country immigration sites** - Look for "visa exemption" sections
3. **Look for "anchor visa" policies** - Search "[country] accepts UK visa holders"
4. **Use IATA Timatic** - If you have access

### PR Title Format for Document Privileges

```
[PRIVILEGE] {document}-{destination}: Brief description
```

Examples:
- `[PRIVILEGE] UK-visa→Albania: 90-day visa-free for UK visa holders`
- `[PRIVILEGE] US-visa→Serbia: Added 90/180 rule clarification`
- `[PRIVILEGE] Schengen→Turkey: e-Visa eligibility with Schengen`

### Example PR Description

```markdown
## Document Privilege Addition

### Bounty: £20 per Valid Addition

- 5-10 countries: £100 + £10 bonus = **£110**
